## What is CTF Crypto?

CTF cryptography challenges involve breaking or exploiting cryptographic systems. Unlike real-world crypto, CTF challenges often have intentional weaknesses to teach concepts.

## Common Challenge Types

### Classical Ciphers
- Caesar cipher
- Substitution ciphers
- Vigenère cipher
- Transposition ciphers

### RSA Challenges
- Small public exponent
- Weak key generation
- Common modulus attack
- Wiener's attack

### Block Ciphers
- ECB mode vulnerabilities
- Padding oracle attacks
- CBC bit-flipping

### Hash Functions
- Hash length extension
- Collision attacks
- Rainbow tables

## Essential Tools

- **SageMath**: For number theory and algebra
- **RsaCtfTool**: Automated RSA attack tool
- **hashcat**: Password cracking
- **CyberChef**: Web-based crypto operations
- **pycryptodome**: Python crypto library

## Learning Resources

- CryptoHack.org for interactive learning
- Study number theory fundamentals
- Practice basic modular arithmetic
- Understand common attack patterns
